            Rihanna became a worldwide star in the early 21st century, known for her distinctive and versatile voice and for her fashionable appearance. I don't even need to introduce her. 

            Not only do I think Rihanna's music is super good, but I have enormous respect for her as a person. She endured a difficult childhood. From zero to hero as the saying goes. 
            But despite her difficult childhood, she managed to become a world star. She started her own brand in 2017 which earned her the billionaire status she carries with her today.

            Giveon Dezmann Evans is an American singer-songwriter. He rose to prominence with his collaboration with Drake on their 2020 single, "Chicago Freestyle".
            He is very well known among the youth. Everyone who listens to him says the same thing about him: He has a voice that you don't get tired of, you can spend hours and hours listening to his songs. In his songs he takes you through the rollercoaster he faces every dahg. As he said before "my life is an emotional rollercoaster". 
            He gained even more popularity earlier this year when he lauched his newest album 'Give or Take'. It reached numer one in the charts and that's because there's not one bad song on it. Don't believe me? Go listen, NOW! I like to refer to 'Give or Take' a blessing for the ears.
